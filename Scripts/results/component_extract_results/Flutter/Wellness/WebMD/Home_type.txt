I'm unable to view the component images extracted from the mobile app screenshot. However, I can certainly help provide a general idea of how to categorize common components from a typical app interface based on their appearance and functionality.

If you provide descriptions of the images or detail what each component looks like, I can offer guidance on matching them to Flutter widget types. Here's a general outline of how to think about these elements:

1. **Search Bar Component**:
   - Description: It's typically an input field with an icon (magnifying glass) and placeholder text.
   - Functionality: This allows users to input and search text.
   - Possible Flutter Widget Type: 
   ```TextField with InputDecoration (prefixIcon: Icon)```

2. **Icons with Text Labels (e.g., "Symptom Checker", "Med Reminders")**:
   - Description: An icon displayed alongside text.
   - Functionality: Often used for navigation or triggering an action.
   - Possible Flutter Widget Type:
   ```Column with Icon and Text```

3. **Button Components (e.g., "Compare Prices")**:
   - Description: A clickable element, usually rectangular.
   - Functionality: Triggers an action when pressed.
   - Possible Flutter Widget Type:
   ```ElevatedButton or TextButton```

4. **Image Carousel/Slider (e.g., image with text "The Summer COVID Wave...")**:
   - Description: Displays a sequence of images horizontally.
   - Functionality: Allows users to view multiple images by swiping.
   - Possible Flutter Widget Type:
   ```PageView with Image and Text```

5. **Bottom Navigation Bar**:
   - Description: Icons with text labels at the bottom of the app screen.
   - Functionality: Provides an easy way to navigate between different app sections.
   - Possible Flutter Widget Type:
   ```BottomNavigationBar```

If you have specific component images, feel free to describe them, and I'll identify the appropriate Flutter widgets.
