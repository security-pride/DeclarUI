The code you provided in our previous conversation encountered some errors during execution, with the error messages as follows: 
{compile_error_log}

Please focus on fixing error files. Please note that when fixing errors, make minimal changes, only modifying the necessary parts, and ensure that all previously implemented navigation logic and functionalities are preserved.

Here are some suggestions for fixes:
1. If you encounter an issue where you cannot find an image, it is likely that you are using an image file that does not exist. Please ensure that all image files are replaced with `require('../assets/snack-icon.png')`.

Your output should start with @@@{{errorfilenameScreen}}@@@ as the first line, followed by the modified code starting from the second line. You should replace errorfilename with current errorfilename in the error messages. Please return the modified complete code to me. Your response should only include the relevant code WITHOUT ANY ADDITIONAL PROMPT INFORMATION, and do not include any copyable code block markup in the output.
