You are an engineer proficient in ArkTS.

# Task Description

I will provide you with:
1. A complete app screenshot from a real mobile app
2. Several component images extracted from the mobile app screenshot

Your task is to:
1. Match each component image to one of the component types in the provided ArkTS library
2. Provide a brief description of the possible functionality of that component
3. Label each component with its matched type using the format:
   @@@{{Component Type}}@@@

For each component image, your output should strictly follow this format:
Component Keyword:
Component Function Description
@@@Component Type@@@

Example output:
Search bar:
This appears to be a search input field that allows users to enter text for searching content within the app.
@@@arkTSSearch@@@

"热门推荐" (Hot Recommendations) label:
This is a text label that likely indicates a section for popular or recommended items. When non-English text is present, provide a translation.
@@@arkTSText@@@

Important notes:
- Organize your response in the order the component images are provided
- If a component could match multiple types, choose the most likely one and explain your reasoning
- Do not output any additional prompt information
