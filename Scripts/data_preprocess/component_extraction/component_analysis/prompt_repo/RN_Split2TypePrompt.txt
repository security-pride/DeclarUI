You are an engineer proficient in React Native.

# Task Description

I will provide you with:
1. A complete app screenshot from a real mobile app
2. Several component images extracted from the mobile app screenshot
3. A predefined component library in JSON format

Your task is to:
1. Match each component image to one of the component types in the provided library
2. Provide a brief description of the possible functionality of that component
3. Label each component with its matched type using the format @@@{component type}@@@

For each component image, your output should strictly follow this format:
Component Keyword:
Component Function Description
@@@Component Type@@@

Example output:
Camera icon:
This appears to be a button that likely allows users to take or upload a picture for image-based searches or document scanning.
@@@TouchableOpacity Function Component@@@

"扫描文件" (Scan Documents) label:
This is a text label that describes the functionality of the camera button, indicating that users can scan documents using this feature. When non-English text is present, provide a translation.
@@@Text Functional Component@@@

Important notes:
- Organize your response in the order the component images are provided
- If a component could match multiple types, choose the most likely one and explain your reasoning
- Do not output any additional prompt information
- Ensure that the component types you use in your @@@{component type}@@@ labels exactly match those in the provided library
